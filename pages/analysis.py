prompt = """Provide general financial wellness advice based on the following principles:

1. **Risk Tolerance**: Explain the importance of understanding one’s risk tolerance when making investment decisions. Discuss how it affects the type of assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) an individual should consider.

2. **Investment Duration**: Provide guidance on how investment horizons (short-term, medium-term, and long-term) should influence investment strategies. Offer insights into how long-term investments typically have higher growth potential but come with more volatility.

3. **Emergency Fund**: Explain why having an emergency fund is crucial and suggest the ideal amount (typically 3-6 months of expenses). Discuss how it serves as a safety net in case of unexpected financial hardships.

4. **Debt Management**: Give advice on how to manage debt effectively. Discuss strategies like paying off high-interest debt first and how reducing debt can improve overall financial health.

5. **Retirement Planning**: Stress the importance of planning for retirement early and contributing consistently to retirement savings accounts like 401(k)s, IRAs, or similar plans. Offer general advice on how to start retirement planning.

6. **Investment Knowledge**: Suggest how increasing one’s knowledge of investing can lead to better decision-making. Recommend resources for learning about different investment types and strategies.

7. **Financial Goals**: Discuss the importance of setting clear financial goals (e.g., saving for a house, retirement, education) and how these goals can help guide investment and savings strategies. 

Keep it concise."""
